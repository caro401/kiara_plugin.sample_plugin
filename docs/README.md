# Autogenerated docs for #PLUGIN_NAME

TODO write some docs about what this is, how it works!

make something that can generate the json file when a tag is pushed

```sh
kiara info plugin explain kiara_plugin.PLUGIN_NAME --format json > /docs/src/content/plugin_data/kiara_plugin.PLUGIN_NAME-vTAG.json"
```

Build and deploy to github pages using [astro's action](https://github.com/withastro/action). Document how to enable that, what it will do, what you need to configure in GH pages, what you need to change to use other things.

remove old mkdocs references
check manifest.in for wh ether docs should be included (and other things?)

AUTHOR EMAIL IN COOKIECUTTER IS NOT OPTIONAL

remember to tell users to enable github actions for repo if publishing/linting - go to actions tab, click enable
